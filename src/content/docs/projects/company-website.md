## What is Company Website?

The Company Website Development project is designed to enhance the company's online presence and streamline the project selection process for students. This initiative focuses on creating a comprehensive website that not only showcases Hardhat Enterprises' capabilities and ongoing projects but also facilitates an informed decision-making process for students interested in joining the company's initiatives.
Key features of the website include:

- User Authentication: Implementing a secure login system that allows users to register and sign in using their Deakin email addresses and passwords, ensuring that access is restricted to affiliated members of the educational community.

- Student Preference System: A feature enabling students to express their project preferences, thereby assisting project leaders in aligning student interests with suitable projects.

- Admin Portal: A specialized interface for project leaders and privileged users to manage project assignments and access comprehensive database functionalities, streamlining the administrative aspects of project coordination.

The technical foundation of the project leverages the Django-Pixel UI kit for frontend design, providing a robust set of UI components and CSS styling out of the box. Backend operations are supported by a SQLite database, co-hosted with the backend on the server to simplify deployment. However, there is an acknowledgment of the need to transition to a more scalable and secure database solution like PostgreSQL in the future. Additionally, the project's architecture, combining both frontend and backend within a single Django repository, offers an integrated development environment but remains flexible for future adjustments should the project's frontend requirements evolve.

Manan Mehta (Technical Contributions:Throughout the seven weeks, my technical contributions have been pivotal in advancing our project. In the initial stages, I familiarized myself with project goals, actively participated in meetings, and engaged in upskilling sessions to enhance my proficiency in Django. As the weeks progressed, I continued to deepen my understanding of the project structure while collaborating with the team lead to clarify roles and expectations. In week four marked a significant achievement as I successfully designed and implemented the navigation bar for web pages it wasnt working, ensuring seamless navigation and enhancing user experience through collaboration with team members. Subsequently, I completed frontend development tasks for primary and additional web pages including contact us page, Deakin Threatmirror and CyberSafe VR incorporating feedback and contributing to the GitHub repository. My consistent participation in team meetings and collaboration with peers and mentors have been important in  completion of frontend development tasks for all assigned web pages by week seven.)
